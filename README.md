- We are a certified **CVE** (Contact Volunteer Examniner) **Team** through both the **ARRL** and **W5YI** **VEC's**

## Amateur Radio Operators 
- They have been referred to as **Ham's** or **Ham Radio Operators** for many generations. 
There are lots of different theories as to why and where that came from but people still refer to **Amateur Radio** as **Ham Radio**. 
In order to be able to transmit or broadcast over the Amateur Radio frequencies you are required to have an **FCC License**.

## The Licensing Process 

Aquiring a license is pretty simple. You have to study first, find a place to test, pass your test, and pay a $35 fee to the FCC. After that, you are issued a random Call Sign.

The best success we have seen over the years is using [hamstudy.org](https://hamstudy.org) to prepare for your test. People that use their tools correctly have a 99.99% passing rate. All you have to do is go the the website and create a FREE account and start studying when you have the time. 

### There are 3 modes they have to prepare for your test:

We suggest starting with **Read Questions**. 
- That way you will see every possible question in the question pool and every correct answer.

Then move to **Study Mode**.
- This is how you will pass and should spend the majority of your test preparation time using this mode. It will track your progress and percentages of all questions seen as well aas your overall aptitude.
- As soon as your aptitude is over 85% and you have seen 100% of the question pool you are ready to test!


The **Practice Test** mode.
- This mode is fine to use, and maybe try a test or 2 after your aptitude is up, but do NOT count on passing a test in this mode as you being ready. Study Mode aptitude is what counts most.

### Thanks for taking the time to read our README.md to get an overview. We will continue to add more information to this repo. There is a ton of things to know once you get your license. Enjoy our Repo.
